# REViewer (DNAnexus Platform App)

## What does this app do?

REViewer visualizes alignments generated by ExpansionHunter v3.0.0 or above, it requires a BAMlet with graph-realigned reads generated by ExpansionHunter and the corresponding variant catalog. More information at https://github.com/Illumina/REViewer. App is created using Docker.

## What are typical use cases for this app?

Use the app to visualize alignments for all or specified loci from ExpansionHunter run for *one* sample.

## What data are required for this app to run?

Required:

- sorted BAMlet generated by ExpansionHunter
- index for sorted BAMlet generated by ExpansionHunter
- VCF file generated by ExpansionHunter
- FASTA file with reference genome (also used by ExpansionHunter)
- FASTA file index
- Variant catalog defining repeat expansion loci (same as used by ExpansionHunter)

Optional:

- Loci to analyze (comma separated list, must be exactly the same as defined in variant catalog)
- Region extension length (length of region around repeat to examine, must be same as specified in ExpansionHunter)
- Output PDF (default: True)
- Output metrics (default: False)


## What does this app output?

- Alignment visualization files for each specified RE locus in .svg or .pdf format
- Alignment metrics (if specified)

## How does this app work?

This app performs the following steps:
  - Runs REViewer v0.2.7 tool (https://github.com/Illumina/REViewer) on sorted and indexed ExpansionHunter output BAMlet file
  - Exports REViewer .svg files to .pdf format (if specified) using Inkscape v0.92.5
